# HDSKA
A concise description
This repository contains HDSKA — a small, focused project for [add short descriptor here: e.g., "high-dimension signal kernel analysis", "hardware diagnostics", etc.]. The goal is to provide clear tools, examples, and utilities to get started quickly and extend for research or production use.

Why this project exists
- Provide a reproducible reference implementation.
- Offer easy-to-follow examples and tests.
- Encourage contributions that improve performance, correctness, and documentation.

Quick features
- Core library for HDSKA processing and helpers
- Command-line utilities for common workflows
- Example datasets and notebooks (where applicable)
- Test suite and CI-ready configuration

Getting started
1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/fahimullah-67/HDSKA.git
    cd HDSKA
    ```
2. Install dependencies (example for Python projects):
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate   # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run a quick example:
    ```
    python examples/run_demo.py
    ```

Usage
- Library: import the main module and use documented functions:
  ```
  from hdksa import core
  result = core.process(data, config)
  ```
- CLI: view help for available commands:
  ```
  hdksa --help
  ```
